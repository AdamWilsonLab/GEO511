## Write a short script to perform the following steps

1. Import the data on atmospheric $CO_2$ from the link below into R


```r
data_url="http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/assets/data/atmospheric/stations/in_situ_co2/monthly/monthly_in_situ_co2_mlo.csv"
```

2. Remove the header of the file to retain only the data
3. Filter out missing data (`-99.99`)
4. Update the column names using the `colnames` vector below


```r
colnames=c("year","month","excel","decimal_year","co2","co2_seasonal","co2_fit","co2_seasonalfit","co2_filled","co2_seasonalfilled")
```

5. Calculate the mean $CO_2$ for each year from the `co2` column
6. plot a simple ggplot line graph of mean annual $CO_2$ concentration each year as shown below





```
