# Reading

- Browse the [HTML Widgets page](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/) for many more examples. Take notes in your readme.md about potential uses in your project.
- Explore the [DyGraphs webpage](http://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)


# Tasks

- Download daily weather data for Buffalo, NY using an API
- Generate a dynamic html visualization of the timeseries.
- Save the graph to your project folder using Export->Save as Webpage

## Background
In this session you will explore several ways to generate dynamic and interactive data displays.  These include making maps and graphs that you can pan/zoom, select features for more information, and interact with in other ways.  The most common output format is HTML, which can easily be embedded in a website (such as your final project!).


```r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(widgetframe)
```

If you don't have the packages above, install them in the package manager or by running `install.packages("widgetframe")`, etc. 

# Objective
> Make a dygraph of recent daily maximum temperature data from Buffalo, NY.

## Detailed Steps

First use the following code to download the daily weather data.


```r
library(rnoaa)
library(xts)
```

```
## Loading required package: zoo
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'zoo'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     as.Date, as.Date.numeric
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'xts'
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:leaflet':
## 
##     addLegend
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':
## 
##     first, last
```

```r
library(dygraphs)

d=meteo_tidy_ghcnd("USW00014733",
                   date_min = "2016-01-01", 
                   var = c("TMAX"),
                   keep_flags=T)
```

```
## file min/max dates: 1938-05-01 / 2020-09-30
```

```r
d$date=as.Date(d$date)
```

Remaining steps:

1. Convert `d` into an `xts` time series object using `xts()`.  You will need to specifify which column has the data (`d$tmax`) and `order.by=d$date`. See `?xts` for help. 
2. Use `dygraph()` to draw the plot
3. Set the title of the dygraph to be `main="Daily Maximum Temperature in Buffalo, NY"`
4. Add a `dyRangeSelector()` with a `dateWindow` of `c("2017-01-01", "2017-12-31")`
5. Explore other options.  You could download another variable (precipitation?) and add it to the plot. Or imagine another way to visualize the data using one of the other interactive libraries.  

## Output

At a minimum, your final graph should look something like this:

<!--html_preserve--><div id="htmlwidget-6cd7bc201e23f6b79a69" style="width:100%;height:500px;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-6cd7bc201e23f6b79a69">{"x":{"url":"CS_12_files/figure-html//widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-3.html","options":{"xdomain":"*","allowfullscreen":false,"lazyload":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script><!--/html_preserve-->

What other visualizations can you make with these data?
