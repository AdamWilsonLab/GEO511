# Training your eyes

## Fix the errors

Do you see any errors in the following code?


```r
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```

## Interpret these error statements

Discuss with your neighbor what the error statement is saying. How would you fix it?


```r
ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
+   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
#> Error in structure(list(data = data, layers = list(), 
#> scales = scales_list(),  : 
#>  argument "data" is missing, with no default
```


```r
fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
#> Error in fliter(mpg, cyl = 8) : could not find function "fliter"
```


```r
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
#> Error in filter(diamond, carat > 3) : object 'diamond' not found
```
