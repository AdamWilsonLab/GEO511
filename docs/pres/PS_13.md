# Project Suggestions

## Messages

If you have something like this in your website:
```
library(dplyr)
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
```

Remove/hide it with:

```
  {r message=F, warning=F, results="hide"}
``` 


## Code output

Don't simply print output!  Better to summarize everything as a table or figure. 


```r
lm(rnorm(10)~runif(10)) %>% 
  summary()
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = rnorm(10) ~ runif(10))
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -1.6249 -0.3599  0.2165  0.4598  1.6566 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
## (Intercept)   0.8172     0.7820   1.045    0.327
## runif(10)    -0.8060     2.0654  -0.390    0.707
## 
## Residual standard error: 1 on 8 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.01868,	Adjusted R-squared:  -0.104 
## F-statistic: 0.1523 on 1 and 8 DF,  p-value: 0.7065
```

## Code output

Convert results to properly formatted output. 


```r
lm(rnorm(10)~runif(10)) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```



term           estimate   std.error   statistic   p.value
------------  ---------  ----------  ----------  --------
(Intercept)        0.93        0.70        1.33      0.22
runif(10)         -1.50        1.14       -1.32      0.22



## Code folding?

If you have really long code chunks, you can add `code_folding: hide` to your YAML to hide all code by default.

```
output:
  html_document:
    code_folding: hide
```

## Chunks

Break up chunks with narrative to explain what the code is doing.  Chunks longer than ~20 lines should probably be broken up.

## Spelling

Don't forget to use spell check (Edit->Check Spelling)!  It's not automatic!


## Convert .Rmd to .R 

You can always convert a .Rmd file to a .R file (with or without comments) like this:

```
knitr::purl(inputfile, outputfile, documentation = 2)
```
