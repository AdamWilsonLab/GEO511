* Statistics
* Graphs
* HTML/Websites (including this one!)

</div>

## Who are you?

* Name
* Degree and Department 
   * _e.g. Masters in GIS in Geography_
* Something about you (< 1 minute, please)
   * Why you are taking this class
   * Something you want to learn / do
   * What you did over the summer

## Course Structure

### Tuesdays
* Review/Questions
* ~30 Minute Presentation
* Student Package presentations
* Student Case Study discussion
* Semi-guided interactive exercises on your laptops

### Thursdays
* Work in groups on case study
* Questions & informal discussion

## 3 Learning Objectives

1. convert data from varied formats/structures to desired format for analysis and visualization
2. clean, transform, and merge data attributes/variables appropriately
3. effectively display and communicate meaning from spatial, temporal, and textual data
4. use current analysis, presentation, and collaboration tools in the spatial data science field.


## This course is NOT
A statistics course (see GEO 505, etc.). 
We will focus on workflow and methods (‘how’ not ‘why’)

## Why write code when you can click?

<img src="01_assets/arcgis.jpg" width=50%></img>

Graphical User Interfaces are useful, especially when you are learning...

## Reproducible Research

* The ability to reproduce results from an experiment or analysis conducted by another*
* Developed from literate programming:
* Logic of the analysis is represented in output 
* Combines computer code with narrative

Learning a programming language can help you learn how to think logically.

<blockquote>
A man who does not know foreign language is ignorant of his own.

Programming gives you access to more computer power.

<blockquote>
The computer is incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Man is unbelievably slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. The marriage of the two is a force beyond calculation. <br> -- Leo Cherne

# Introduction to R

## R Project for Statistical Computing

* Free and Open source
* Data manipulation
* Data analysis tools
* Great graphics
* Programming language
* 6,000+ free, community-contributed packages
* A supportive and increasing user community

R is a dialect of the S language  developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T) by John Chambers et. al. (same group developed C and UNIX©)

## What is the R environment?

* effective data handling and storage facility
* suite of operators for (vectorized) calculations
* large, coherent, integrated collection of tools for data analysis
* graphical capabilities (screen or hardcopy)
* well-developed, simple, and effective programming language which includes:
     * conditionals
     * loops
     * user defined functions
    * input and output facilities

## Reproducible, Portable, & Transparent

. . . all the code and data used to recreate the Mann’s original analysis has been made available to the public [...] Since the analysis is in R, anyone can replicate the results and examine the methods. 
(Matthew Pocernich, _R news_ 10/31/06). [link](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/ccr/ammann/millennium/refs/WahlAmmann_ClimChange2006.html)

## R Graphics

## Spatial data in R
Packages: sf, sp, maptools, rgeos, raster, ggmap 
Examples:
 species range overlays

## Parallel Processing
For BIG jobs:
multi-core processors / high performance computing with foreach.

## Strengths & Limitations

* Just-in-time compilation
     * Slower than compiled languages <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
     * Faster to compose <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> 
* Many available packages <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i>
* Most operations conducted in RAM
     * RAM can be limiting and/or expensive <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
     * `Error: cannot allocate vector of size X Mb`
     * Various packages and clever programming can overcome this… <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i>
* Free like beer **AND** speech! <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i>

# Training your eyes

## Fix the errors

Do you see any errors in the following code?


```r
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```

## Interpret these error statements

Discuss with your neighbor what the error statement is saying. How would you fix it?


```r
ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
+   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
#> Error in structure(list(data = data, layers = list(), 
#> scales = scales_list(),  : 
#>  argument "data" is missing, with no default
```


```r
fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)
#> Error in fliter(mpg, cyl = 8) : could not find function "fliter"
```


```r
filter(diamond, carat > 3)
#> Error in filter(diamond, carat > 3) : object 'diamond' not found
```

## Let's get coding...

Open [today's activity](../01_Rintro.html) and work through the exercise.
